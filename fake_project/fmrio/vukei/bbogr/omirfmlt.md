# Grey Fox

## Classified: Top Secret // SCI // NOFORN

*Clearance Level UMBRA Required*

### Overview

Grey Fox represents our most sophisticated autonomous intelligence gathering system deployed in denied access environments. Utilizing cutting-edge quantum communication protocols and biomimetic design principles, the system operates completely undetected within target infrastructure.

### Capabilities

- **Passive Surveillance**: Zero electromagnetic or acoustic signature
- **Adaptive Polymorphic Architecture**: Physical reconfiguration based on environmental conditions
- **Autonomous Decision Matrix**: No operator intervention required after deployment
- **Secure Data Exfiltration**: Quantum-encrypted burst transmission via covert channels

### Current Deployment Status

Initial field tests exceeded all performance metrics. Full operational capability achieved in three primary target zones. Asset sustainability projected at 36+ months without maintenance.

### Security Protocols

- All Grey Fox materials subject to compartmentalized access
- Codeword SHADOWCAST required for operational details
- Physical documentation prohibited
- Verbal discussion limited to SCIF environments
