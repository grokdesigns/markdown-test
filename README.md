Here's a super awesome README file. Mimicked content should be right under this:

<!--MIMIC_START-->
Here is some content I want to regularly update my README.md file with:

```

This is some test content from README.mimic file.


```

# h1 Heading for me README!
## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading
<!--MIMIC_END-->

In this example, you can see there is no content above when the file is initially committed.

Here is the rest of my README after content was added.
