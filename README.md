Here's a super awesome README file. Mimicked content should be right under this:

<!--MIMIC_START-->
Here is some content I want to regularly update my README.md file with:

```

This is some test content from README.mimic file.

Now I'm updating this template to show the README changes.

```
<!--MIMIC_END-->

In this example, you can see there is no content above when the file is initially committed.

Here is the rest of my README after content was added.
